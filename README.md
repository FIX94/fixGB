# fixGB
This is still quite early in development so it cant do all that much, its essentially the GB version of my NES Emulator fixNES.  
If you want to check it out for some reason I do include a windows binary in the "Releases" tab, if you want to compile it go check out the "build" files.  
You will need freeglut as well as openal-soft to compile the project, it should run on most systems since it is fairly generic C code.  
Right now most standard GB titles using MBC1, 3 and 5 should work just fine and also save into standard .sav files.  
You can also listen to .gbs files by dragging them in, changing tracks works by pressing left/right.    

Controls right now are keyboard only and do the following:  
Y/Z is A  
X is B  
A is Start  
S is select  
Arrow Keys is DPad  
Keys 1-9 integer-scale the window to number  
P is Pause    

That is all I can say about it right now, who knows if I will write some more on it.
